# Quarto Notebooks for Reproducible Research

Quarto lets you combine code, text, figures, and tables into reproducible reports:

- Supports R, Python, Julia; render to HTML/PDF/Docx
- YAML header to control metadata and bibliography
- Chunk options to cache, eval, and echo flexibly

Tip: create a project template and run `quarto render` in CI for automated publishing.
