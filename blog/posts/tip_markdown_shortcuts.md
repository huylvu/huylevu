# Handy Markdown Shortcuts for Faster Writing

A few lightweight shortcuts that speed up writing:

- Use `---` or `***` to insert a horizontal rule
- Type `> ` for quick callouts/notes as blockquotes
- Use fenced code blocks with language for highlight:

```bash
# Example
ls -la
```

- Start a list with `-` or `1.` then press Enter to continue automatically
- Wrap text with `**bold**` or `_italic_` for emphasis
