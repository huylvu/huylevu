# GDP: The Accounting Identity and Three Measures

This note is inspired by a clear explanation of the three ways to measure GDP: production, expenditure, and income. The core is the accounting identity ensuring total supply equals total use within a period.

- Definition: GDP is the monetary value of final goods and services in a period

- Measurement issues: statistical discrepancy; imports subtracted to avoid double counting
