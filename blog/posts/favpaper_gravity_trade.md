# The Gravity Model in Trade

The gravity model is the most successful empirical framework to explain bilateral trade flows based on economic size and trade costs (distance, borders, institutions).

- Structural form (Anderson & van Wincoop) with multilateral resistance
- PPML estimation to handle zero trade and heteroskedasticity
- Applications: evaluate RTAs/FTAs, non-tariff barriers, shocks like COVID-19
